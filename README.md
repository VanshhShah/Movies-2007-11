# SQL Movie Recommendation Project (IMDb Dataset)

This project demonstrates how to extract and analyze movie data using SQL from the IMDb dataset. We focus on building a foundational engine that shows top-rated movies, trending actors, and active directors by querying raw IMDb `.tsv` files converted to `.csv`.


# Dataset Information

The data used in this project is sourced from [IMDb Open Datasets](https://datasets.imdbws.com/):

- `movie.csv` â†’ movie titles and metadata  
- `rating.csv` â†’ IMDb user ratings  
- `crew.csv` â†’ director and writer data  
- `names.csv` â†’ actor/actress and crew member details  

These `.tsv` files were preprocessed and imported into a SQL environment for querying.


# Features Implemented

- ðŸ“Š Extract ratings of selected movies by title
- ðŸŽ­ Identify most frequent actors in top-rated films
- ðŸŽ¬ Analyze directors with the most high-rated projects
- ðŸ§¹ Export cleaned data into `ratings.csv` for further analysis or visualizations


# Project Structure

# How to Run
Load all .csv files into your SQL database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)

Import your custom movie list (with titles and ids)

Run the SQL script: extract_ratings.sql

Export the results as ratings.csv


# Future Improvements
Add genre-based filtering

Match movies based on actor collaborations

Create a web interface to interact with the recommendations.
